**Frontend Developer Assignment: UI Implementation**

**Objective:**
Your task is to create a user interface (UI) as demonstrated in the attached video using Reactand any CSS library of your choice.

**Video Reference:**
[frontend-assignment.webm](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GOJDewvtyaFWHo2iDjoLbNAlJYOVVM9n/view)

**UI Description:**
The UI to be implemented resembles a table structure. Each row represents a state, with the first column dedicated to product filters and the subsequent columns representing design variants. Please create a relevant response structure which you can hardcode for the functionality to work. Also note that the UI should be as close to that shared in the video.

**Functionalities:**
**Add/Delete a State:**
Implement functionality to dynamically add and remove states (rows) in the table.

**Add/Delete Variant Columns:**
Implement functionality to dynamically add and remove variant columns in the table.

**Row Reordering:**
Allow users to reorder the state rows using drag-and-drop functionality.

**Design Insertion (Optional):**
Allow users to insert a design into a specific variant column.

**Eye for perfection :**
If the number of variants added become more than 4 then it should have a scroll as shown in the video, Thinking out of the box is also welcome 

**Guidelines:**

Use React for building the UI components. Next.js is preferred for its advanced features and optimizations.
You are free to choose any CSS library (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI) to style the application. Consistency and responsiveness are key.
Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
